**shortcut for going to you main project**


***write below command then you easily go to your main project***


``
code -r project name
``


*** why useEffect showing mount component two time ? ***

``
becase of   <StrictMode> in main.jsx as you know that in production becuase of this react make that component to work one for check and to work one for real
``





Exactly, that’s a perfect way to put it! Rendering is like the planning or the blueprint phase, where React decides what the UI should look like. Mounting, on the other hand, is when that plan actually becomes reality, and the component appears in the DOM.
