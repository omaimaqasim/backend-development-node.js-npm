      What is a module?
      → A module is a block of code that we can borrow and use in our project.
    -->

    <!-- 
      If you want to install different modules, you use npm install with module name.
      Example: npm install express
    -->

    <!-- 
      When you change something in a Node.js file, you normally have to reload 
      the server manually. To reload automatically, use nodemon:
        1. npm install --global nodemon
        2. nodemon filename.js
    -->

    <!-- 
      nvm (Node Version Manager):
      → Lets you work with multiple Node.js versions on the same system.
    -->
