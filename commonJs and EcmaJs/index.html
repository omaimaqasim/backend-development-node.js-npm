  <!-- ðŸ”¹ Difference Between Modules and npm -->
  <!-- 
    - Modules = Actual pieces of code (built-in, custom, or third-party).
    - npm = Tool that downloads and manages third-party modules.
  -->

  <!-- ðŸ”¹ npm init -->
  <!-- 
    - If you want to skip all questions while running npm init:
        npm init -y
    - Later you can edit package.json manually.
  -->

  <!-- ðŸ”¹ What is a Module? -->
  <!-- 
    - A module is a block of code that we can borrow and use in our project.
    - Types of modules:
        1. Built-in (fs, http, path, etc.)
        2. Custom (your own code in files)
        3. Third-party (installed using npm)
  -->

  <!-- ðŸ”¹ Installing Modules with npm -->
  <!-- 
    - To install different modules:
        npm install <moduleName>
    - Example:
        npm install express
  -->

  <!-- ðŸ”¹ Auto-reload with Nodemon -->
  <!-- 
    - Normally, you must restart server after changes.
    - Nodemon reloads automatically.
    - Steps:
        1. npm install --global nodemon
        2. nodemon filename.js
  -->

  <!-- ðŸ”¹ nvm (Node Version Manager) -->
  <!-- 
    - Lets you work with multiple Node.js versions on the same system.
    - Example: switching between old and new versions easily.
