 Node.js File System Challenges
==============================

Q1. Write a program that:
    - Creates a file notes.txt with text "My first note".
    - Then appends " and this is updated" to the same file.
    - Finally, reads the file and prints its content.
    (Do this in async way only using fs.writeFile, fs.appendFile, fs.readFile).   (DONE)

Q2. Convert Q1 into sync version using writeFileSync, appendFileSync, readFileSync. 
    Compare outputs of async vs sync. (DONE).

Q3. Write code that checks if test.txt exists:
    - If it does, print "File already exists".
    - If not, create it with text "Hello World". (DONE).

Q4. Delete a file temp.txt using fs.unlink(). 
    Add error handling so if the file doesnâ€™t exist, it prints "File not found".

Q5. Use fs.readdir() to list all files inside a folder named myFolder.

Q6. Use fs.promises + async/await to:
    - Write students.json file with an array of names.
    - Then read it back and parse into an array.
    - Log each student name one by one.
