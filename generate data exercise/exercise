 Generate dummy data in this format in a collection called employees 
 in a database called company:

 {
   name: "Harry",
   salary: 45000000,
   language: "Python",
   city: "New York",
   isManager: true
 }

 Generate 10 such records when a button called "generate data" is clicked.
 Create an Express app with Mongoose to achieve it.
 Every time the button is clicked, you should clear the collection first.
