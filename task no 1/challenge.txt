ðŸ“‚ Question Task: Organize files into folders by their extensions

You are given a folder with files like:
  name.jpg, name.png, this.pdf, harry.zip, Rohan.zip, cat.jpg

Your task is to write a Node.js program that does the following:

1. Read all the files in the given folder.

2. For each file, get its extension (e.g., .jpg, .png, .pdf, .zip).

3. Create a separate folder for each unique extension (jpg, png, pdf, zip).

4. Move each file into its respective extension folder.
   Example: "name.jpg" â†’ goes into "jpg" folder
            "harry.zip" â†’ goes into "zip" folder

5. If the folder for an extension already exists, do not create it again.

6. Print a message for each file moved, showing its new location.

âœ… Expected Output Structure:
  jpg/name.jpg
  jpg/cat.jpg
  png/name.png
