A parameter is a placeholder that waits to receive a value from outside 
 (like from a URL or a function call).

 Once it receives that value, it behaves like a variable inside the code.

A variable, on the other hand, is something we create ourselves inside the code 
 to store a value â€” not given automatically from outside.
